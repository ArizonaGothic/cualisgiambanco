		<h2><a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/">HathiTrust Digital Library</a></h2>
		<h2>System Introduction</h2>
			<h3>Context</h3>
			<p>HathiTrust was founded in 2008 as a collaboration between <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/member-list/">a list of academic and research libraries</a>. It is a not-for-profit service that preserves over 18 million items in its Digital Libary. Hathitrust offers free access to its collection, which is constantly growing as new members join the project and upload new information.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/about/mission-history/">mission</a> of HathiTrust is, "to contribute to research, scholarship, and the common good by collaboratively collecting, organizing, preserving, communicating, and sharing the record of human knowledge." It takes its name from the Hindi word for elephant, an animal known for its strong memory.</p>
	
			<h3>Users</h3>
			<p>Information on HathiTrust is uploaded and curated by <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/member-list/">an international community of research and academic libraries</a>.</p>				
			<p>"Through their common efforts and deep commitment to the public good, the libraries support the teaching and learning activities of the faculty, students or researchers at their home institutions, and the scholarly needs of the broader public as well."</p>	
			<p>Ultimately, HathiTrust is an attractive candidate for libraries to use in preservation as it offers free and widespread access to data in a consolidated and well-known format. Individuals who are seeking information should definitely utilize it as a research tool as well.</p>

			<h3>Content</h3>
			<p>HathiTrust provides free access to wide amount of digitized items... over 18 million!</p>
			<p>Users can search through the various collections and are provided with a title, a date the collection item was last updated, the size of the collection, and a description.</p>
			<p>Certain collections are featured and can be browsed immediately; otherwise, users have options to filter and search the collections based on their topic and size.</p>


		<h2>Discussion</h2>
			<h3>Interesting Features</h3>
				<p>Once a collection is viewed, users are able to download particular articles/documents and can even utilize features that allow them to search within these files. The interface for accessing and sharing documents is very smooth and functional.</p>
				<p>There is clearly an effort made by HathiTrust itself as an organization to feature certain information and encourage the spread of its own platform. There is a clearly stated <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/about/mission-history/">mission</a>, and the organization has a very clear vision of what they aim to do with their platform.</p>


			<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Pros</th>
						<th>Cons</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
    						<td>Ease-of-Use: Access to uploads is easy. Users can search through files and documents using a very friendly interface.</td>
						<td>Submission: The process for submitting large amounts of files to HathiTrust can be quite burdensome.</td>
     					</tr>
					<tr>
    						<td>One-Stop-Shop: HathiTrust offers a consolidated source of information and a resource whose main focus is accessibility.</td>
						<td>Yet-Another-Site: Uploading things to HathiTrust can be somewhat redundant when the information can already be found elsewhere.</td>
     					</tr>
				</table>
			
			<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>If I were to try and improve HathiTrust, I would first make an effort to simplify the submission process for organizations that are interested in using the platform. I currently work with the CUA Library in submitting items to HathiTrust; the process is very difficult and requires a lot of work on the metadata side of things. Simplifying this upload process and requiring less legwork from users would make them much more inclined to use HathiTrust as a platform.</li>
				<li>Due to the extremely large size of the catalog, I would put a lot of extra effort into featuring content and giving users an idea of what is available. I have never found myself linked to HathiTrust from a library website; I think this sort of integration would make the platform more usable as it would give users a better idea of what is there. As it stands, HathiTrust feels like a site that you need to know to use ahead of time.</li>
